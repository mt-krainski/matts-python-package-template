# Example Package using Matt's Python Package Template

This is just an example showing how a composed package would look like.

This is also used to update the dependencies for the cookiecutter template - dependabot will scan this package and update the dependencies here and we have a CI job that takes these updates and applies them also to the template.

Don't make changes here manually. Instead make changes to the template and regenerate this package using cookiecutter.
